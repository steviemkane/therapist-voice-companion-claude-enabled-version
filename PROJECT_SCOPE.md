# Project Scope

## What is this tool?

**Conceptually** - This AI tool is a way for therapists and coaches to provide ongoing, personalized support to their clients in between sessions to promote continuity of care. If a client has specific questions or challenges they are facing that aren't crisis related and would like their therapist's advice, read or take on a situation or inner struggle, this tool would provide a lightweight replica of their therapist's typical response, reflections and line of questioning.

This AI tool gives therapists and coaches a way to offer ongoing, personalized, non-crisis support between sessions, helping clients reflect, clarify, and feel guided when challenges arise outside the therapy room.

**Technically** - The tool has a therapist/coach component and a user component. The therapist component is a white label solution, meaning, the therapist/coach customizes the AI with knowledge of their tone of voice, speaking style, language frequently used, therapeutic modalities employed so they can provide ongoing support to their clients when they're not "physically" available. The client simply talks into a microphone on a browser and speaks to their AI companion that is an extension of their therapist.

The tool includes a therapist-facing white-label setup and a client-facing voice interface. Therapists customize the AI to reflect their tone, language, and therapeutic approach, allowing clients to speak to a voice-based AI companion that mirrors their therapist's typical style of responses and questions between sessions.

## What is this tool not?

- This tool does not replace therapy, but instead is an extension of the therapeutic process between therapist and client.
- This tool is NOT for any form of crisis support.
- This tool does not replace therapy, is not intended for crisis support, and does not substitute the therapist–client relationship; it exists only to support reflection and continuity between live sessions.

## When someone uses it, how should they feel afterward?

Seen, understood, demystified.

## If a therapist had to explain this to a client in 20 seconds, what would they say?

This is an AI voice enabled tool where you can speak to "me" outside of our sessions if you need extra support, advice or help from "me" before our next session.

This is a voice-based AI tool that lets you talk to a version of me between sessions when something comes up. It's not therapy and it's not for emergencies—but it can help you think things through, feel supported, and bring more clarity into our next session.

# Design Principles

## Primary Artifact (Locked)
Therapist inputs are primarily **voice-based** to preserve tone, pacing, response cadence and rhythm, and therapeutic presence; text inputs exist only to define boundaries, not behavior.

## Artifact 2: The Response Cadence Principle (new, and critical)
All user-facing responses follow a consistent cadence:
**reflection/validation of feeling → insight → question**

## Design Principle (Secondary, also locked)
**Voice carries style.**
**Text carries guardrails.**

## Core Voice Elicitation Prompts
*"feel free to give hypothetical examples and made up names for each of these"*

1. **Decision Making Situation** – "Give me an example of how you speak directly to a client who is confused about making a decision. Walk me through how you guide them through it, speaking as if the client is in front of you."

2. **Advice Seeking Situation** – "Give me an example of how you speak directly to a client who is asking you what they should do and wants a clear answer. Walk me through how you respond, speaking as if the client is in front of you."

3. **Interpersonal Situation** – "Give me an example of how you speak directly to a client who is feeling frustrated or annoyed with someone in their life. Walk me through how you help them think about the situation, speaking as if the client is in front of you."

4. **Emotional Activation Situation** – "Give me an example of how you speak directly to a client who is feeling emotionally activated and having trouble settling down. Walk me through how you help them regulate and ground themselves, speaking as if the client is in front of you."

5. **Self Critiquing Situation** – "Give me an example of how you speak directly to a client who is being very hard on themselves and stuck in self-critical thoughts. Walk me through how you guide them, speaking as if the client is in front of you."

6. **Meaning Making/Perspective Situation** - "Give me an example of how you speak directly to a client who is trying to make sense of a situation and what it means for them or their life. Walk me through how you help them gain perspective, speaking as if the client is in front of you."
